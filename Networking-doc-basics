 1) Switching :
  ------------
     For example We have a 2 servers(server A and server B) vm's or cloud servers, How does server A reaches Server B ? We connect them using switch, and switch create a network containing two the 2 servers.
     To Connect them through a switch we need an interface on each host, physical or virtual depends on host. 
     To See the interfaces of the host We use ip link Command.

     In this case if we look at the interface named eth0 that we will be using connecting to the switch.
     Lets assume we have a network with 192.168.1.0 we then assign the servers with ip addresses of the same network. For this we use the command ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev ech0
