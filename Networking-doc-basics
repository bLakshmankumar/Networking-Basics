Networking pre-requisites :
===========================
> Switching 
> Routing
> Default Gateway
> DNS configuration on linux
-----------------------------------------------------------
 1) Switching :
  ------------
     For example We have a 2 servers(server A and server B) vm's or cloud servers, How does server A reaches Server B ? We connect them using switch, and switch create a network containing two the 2 servers.
     To Connect them through a switch we need an interface on each host, physical or virtual depends on host. 
     To See the interfaces of the host We use ip link Command.
     In this case if we look at the interface named eth0 that we will be using connecting to the switch.
     Lets assume we have a network with 192.168.1.0 we then assign the servers with ip addresses of the same network. For this we use the command ip addr add 192.168.1.10/24 dev ech0 and ip addr add 192.168.1.11/24 dev ech0
     Once the links are up and once Ip addresses are assigned to the servers can now communicate with each other through the switch.
     The switch can only enab;e communication with in a network. which means it reaceive packets from a host on the network and delivered to other serverswith in the same network.

  2) Routing : 
     ---------
     A Router helps connnects two networks together and Routers, which are devices responsible for routing, maintain a routing table. 
     This table contains information about the available paths to different destinations and helps the router make decisions on how to forward packets.
     Example:
     --------
     Let's consider a practical example of routing in the context of the internet. Imagine you are sitting in your home in New York and want to access a website hosted in California.

     Packet Creation:
     ----------------
     The data (request for the website) is broken down into packets.
     Routing Table:
     --------------
     Your home router has a routing table with information about the paths to various destinations, including the path to California.
     Destination Address:
     ---------------------
     The destination address in the packet indicates that it needs to reach a server in California.
     Routing Decision:
     -----------------
     Your home router looks at its routing table, determines the best path to California, and forwards the packet to the next router on that path.
     Forwarding:
     -----------
     Each router along the way makes similar decisions, forwarding the packet towards California.
     Arrival at Destination:
     -----------------------
     The packet reaches the destination server in California, and the server responds by sending packets back along the same path.
      
      This process ensures that data can be efficiently and reliably transmitted between devices across different networks, 
      overcoming the geographical and topological challenges of the network infrastructure.
      Routing is essential for the functioning of the internet and other computer networks.
3) Gateway :
  ----------
    If Network is a Room, The Gateway is a Door to the outside world, to other networks or to the internet.The systems need to now where the door is to go through that.
    To see the existing routing configuration on a system use route command.
      > route command will displays the kernal routing table.
     IMP :
     -----
      To configure a gateway on server b(192.168.1.1) to reach the other server c which is running on other network.(192.168.2.1). run the below command.
      ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 via 192.168.1.1
      verify the route process using route command.
